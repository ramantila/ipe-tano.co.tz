                        and/or the authorities of the violation. Our right to delete will not be conditioned on an
                        explanation, although we will strive to inform the Registered User about the deletion and the
                        reason hereof.

                        7.1 We may at any time, in our sole discretion, revise or change these User Terms. We will
                        make an effort to provide reasonable advance notice of any such changes. We may at any
                        time, in our own discretion and without notice, close, change or reorganize the Website. As a

                        revision or change of the User Terms will be stated on the Website. We will furthermore
                        strive to inform the Registered Users about the change of the User Terms. The Registered

                        7.2 Should any of these User Terms be regarded as unlawful or without effect and therefore
                        not to be enforced, this will not have any effect on the applicability and enforcement of the
                        remaining part of the User Terms.

                        time for any reason without liability. If we do so, or if you elect to delete your profile, any
                        rights granted to you herein will immediately cease. Sections 2-10 will survive any
                        termination of the User Terms.

                        faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our

                        agreement between you and Ipe Tano concerning your use of the Website and supersede and

                    <p>
                        11.2 Nothing contained in these User Terms can be construed as creating any agency,
                        partnership or other form of joint enterprise between us. Our failure to require your
                        performance of any provision hereof will not affect our full right to require such performance
                        at any time thereafter, nor may our waiver of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or
                        held to be a waiver of the provision itself. You may not assign any rights granted to you
                        hereunder, and any such attempts are void.
